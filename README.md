# Project Name: Securiform

## Project Overview
Securiform is a web application that utilizes a modern tech stack, including Symfony for backend development and React for frontend development. Built to provide a robust solution, it supports features like database interactions, a mail service, and an API-driven interface.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securiform.git
   cd securiform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   For PHP dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   For JavaScript dependencies, navigate to the frontend directory (if applicable) and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your environment variables according to your needs. Refer to `.env.example` for structure.

4. **Run Docker Containers:**
   Utilize Docker to run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is set up and running, you can access it through your web browser at `http://localhost:8000` (if using default Docker settings).

### Running the Frontend
If you're working on the frontend, you may need to start the React server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The dev server is usually available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features
- **API-Driven**: Built using Symfony and API Platform for easy integration and data handling.
- **Database Support**: Employs PostgreSQL as the database through Doctrine ORM.
- **Email Handling**: Leverages the Symfony Mailer and provides a mail testing interface using Mailpit.
- **Modular Architecture**: Codebase laid out to support extensions and enhancements.
- **React Frontend**: A modern UI built with React, ensuring responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
